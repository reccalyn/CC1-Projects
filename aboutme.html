<p>My mother named Jhoan Sabinosa, she is 36 years old, and yeah! she's a bit younger than the mother of some of my classmates but who cares? as long as she always provides our needs, by the way, My father named Reynaldo Ronidel, he is 35 years old he's 1 year younger than my mother, we have a small business called "knittingan" because my mom sew some bonnets and knitted jackets and my father is the one who deliver it in town. I have one sibling named Rhiane Cassandra Ronidel she is already 11 years old, currently she is grade 5 student at Loakan Elementary School. We are simple but happy family.</p>
