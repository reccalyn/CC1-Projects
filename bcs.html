<p>The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program provides the students with an in-depth understanding on the theoretical and applied aspects of computing. Students gain knowledge of the theories along with the methodologies and techniques in the research and development of multifaceted software systems as well as new knowledge in the field of computing.</p>

<p>To give emphasis on the current areas of computing three concentrations for the BSCS program were identified namely: the Digital Arts and Animation Track, the Mobile Technology Track and the Embedded Application Track.</p>
